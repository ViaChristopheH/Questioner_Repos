Crowd-source questions for a meetup
Project by Andela

*This system (Questioner) helps the meetup organizer prioritize 
questions to be answered. Other users can vote on asked questions and they bubble to the top 
or bottom of the log. 

*Ever listened to “Crowd-source questions for a meetup”? 
Here comes Questioner. Questioner helps the meetup organizer prioritize questions to be answered. 
Other users can vote on asked questions and they bubble to the top or bottom of the log. 

*It is understandable that this is a platform on which different users can have a role and influence
in prioritizing questions according to how the relevance and priority is perceived generally since
these ones are subjective to everyone. 

*However, admins and users have different pathways to pass when navigating the platform regardless
their influence and impact and meetups outcomes each. For instances, an admin can log in as “an admin” 
to be able to create or delete a meetup. This is not possible for users.

*Meetups are created as soon as possible prior to be held which allows a better preparation for a meetup. 
This is technically and professionally accomplished through the Meet up creation form. Users can comment
on a specific meetup for further consideration of their points of view, suggestions and the like.
 
*Users can also rate the relevance and priority of questions of specific meetups by upvoting or downvoting 
them as posted by other users depending on a topic or title of a certain meetup. There might seldom be 
complications in account manipulation for a user since even after creating afresh an account as a user, 
users may reset their password. There is no need to panic. This feature is affordable as well to any admins 
that might forget their password.

*To prove the openness and transparency of questioner, questions are sorted based on the number of upvotes a question has, 
which is where the meetup organizer(s) bases to prioritize questions most users are interested in.
