                      <p>
		              Herein, is explained the set of sequences comprising the functions of the interface part of questioner. Further details are provided on what and how an admin or a user, the essential parties of questioner, can handle the features of QUESTIONER system.
                      </p>

	<h2>
			ADMIN'S PRIVILEGES VS. USERS' RIGHTS
		</h2>

		<p>
			
			However, admins and users have different pathways to pass when navigating the platform regardless their influence and impact and meetups outcomes each. For instances, an admin can <a href="admin_s_page.html">log in as “an admin”</a> to be able to create or delete a meetup. This is not possible for users. Rather, they can <a href="meetup_questions.html">post a comment to a question</a> for any meetup.

		</p>

		<P>
			Meetups are created as soon as possible prior to be held which allows a better preparation for a meetup. This is technically and professionally accomplished through the <a href="meetup_creation_form.html"> Meet up creation form.</a> through the same process <a href="deleting_a_meetup.html"> meetups can be deleted.</a>
            Users can <a href="questioner_comment.html"> comment on a specific meetup</a> for further consideration of their points of view, suggestions and the like. Users can also rate the relevance and priority of questions of specific meetups by <a href="voting_for_question.html">upvoting or downvoting</a> them as posted by other users depending on a topic or title of a certain meetup.

		</P>

		<P>
			There might seldom be complications in account manipulation for a user since users have their profile <a href="user_s_profile.html">(User's profile)</a> as even after creating afresh an account as a user, users may reset their password. There is no need to panic. This feature is affordable as well to any admins that might forget their password.

		</P>

		<P>
			To prove the openness and transparency of questioner, questions are sorted based on the number of upvotes a question has, which is where the meetup organizer(s) bases to prioritize questions most users are interested in.

		</P>
